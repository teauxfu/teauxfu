### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [teauxfu](https://teauxfu.dev). I like to work on fun stuff, and I'm willing to work on difficult stuff.

I have a B.S. in chemistry, I love sharing knowledge, and I tend to enjoy hacking (with an axe or text editor as appropriate).
When I was in school I focused mostly on organic synthesis and catalysis. I might go back for a PhD one of these days. 

After graduating I worked as an analyst at an oilfield lab. I quickly realized having a coder in a lab is a huge asset, that I enjoy doing it, and that I'm pretty decent at it. My first major project was in Python, and written in two parts: a thin wrapper/API for talking to some lab equipment [py-hplc](https://github.com/pct-code/py-hplc), and a GUI that consumes it for running experiments [ScaleWiz](https://github.com/pct-code/scalewiz). 

I'm currently an independent contractor and branching out into .NET development. I'm enthusiastic about interactive programming tools like Jupyter notebooks, and I'd like to see more use of them in data exploration and reporting -- especially in fields dominated by Microsoft Excel / VBA macros. Python + Pandas is so much nicer than Excel for most things once you get the hang of it. 

I think I'd like to work on a JAMstack project for funsies, and lately I've been cautiously learning React.
